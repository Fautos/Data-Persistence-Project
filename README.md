The main objectives were:
 - Saving data between scenes:
   - Create a "start menu" scene with a text entry field prompting the user to enter their name. The user's name will be shown during the playthrough along its score.
 - Saving data between sessions:
   - The highest score and the name of the user who achived it will be shown during the playthrough.
   - Once the playthrough is finished, the user's name and its score will be saved and stored in a leaderboard.
   - The updated leaderboard will be stored and must be shown every time the game is run.
